# Polygon(Matic) Case Study
## Overview and Origin
Polygon is a company that was launched in October 2017 by founders Russ Frushtik, Griffin McElroy, and Chris Plante. The company's goal was to connect and grow Ethereum-compatible projects and blockchains. To achieve this, Polygon uses MATIC tokens to govern and secure the polygon network and to pay transactional fees. The company was able to fund this project through the sale of their private token MATIC, which has accumulated more that $450 million dollars.

## Buisness Activites
Polygon is a protocol stack that aims to solve Ethereum's scalability problems by handling transactions on a separate, Ethereum-compataible blockchain and return them to the main Ethereum blockchain after processing. This reduces the load on the Ethereum network, allowing for faster transactions and lower transaction costs. You are able to buy and trade NFTs without paying transaction fees, or better known as gas-fees. The cool thing is, this is free to use for anyone. Polygon operates on an open source programming language called Solidity, What makes Polygon so efficient at what it does, happens to be the algorithmic mechanism called "Proof-of-stake" which validates entries into a distributed database and keeps the database secure. Though Polygon isn't the only one in the buisness trying to speed up transaction fees. Arbitrum and Optimism both offer the same service which could be looked at as competitors to Polygon. One key advantage Polygon has over itss other competitors is that they have the ability to stake its native token, MATIC, on the polygon blockchain. Which allows users to earn annual interest for participating in the validation of transactions on the blockchain. The competition does not offer this feature.

## Landscape 
With the launch of Bitcoin in 2009 that crypto/blockchain technology became widely known to the general public. Bitcoin was also the first decentralized coin which meant it wasn't controlled by any government, instead it relied on a decentralized network of computers to keep track of each transaction on a public ledger, thus blockchain was born. Since then many coins and tokens have become big. Most notable being Ethereum. With the rise of Ethereum it was clear that it still had some issues regarding being slow and clunky. With that Polygon was established.  Polygon happens to fall under the blockchain and cryptocurrency finance domain as it has its own token and works together with Ethereum.

## Results
With the release of Etherium 1.0, it was clear there needed to be a solution to the slow and expensive gas fees. Thus Polygon was established in 2017, and it makes buying and trading NFTs super quick and cheap. Which has had an astounding affect on the world of crypto. However with the release of Ethereum 2.0 right around the corner, It's promised that Eth. 2.0 will address these issues. Therefore could lead investors to worry for the future of Polygon. Compared to its competitors Polygon seems to surpass its competition in terms of TVL. (total value locked) They stand roughly $4 billion in total value locked compared to other zk-rollup protocols which only stands at $290 million. Polygon is difficult to over take with an astounding 65,000 transactions a second compared to a new blockchain CHIA, which takes about 5 seconds a transaction.

## Reccomendations
Right now crypto/blockchain can be a confusing topic for the average person, who is not super interested in the topic. If I were to advise Polygon, I would purpose making the ease of access to crypto/blockchain much easier and simpler for the masses. Most ideally we would have them not even know they are interacting with the platform. Such as an app, they could also possibility partner with everyday companies, for examaple Chipotle. They could make a smart contract that could earn you tokens for ordering 5 steak bowls. Blockchain, solidity, and Java would be a necessity for making these ideas happen. Blockchain because that's where eveything will be stored. Solidity to develop the smart contracts. Laslty Java to develop the mobile apps. I would emphasizes trying develop apps on our mobile devices for these services, Why? because that's what people use everyday.
